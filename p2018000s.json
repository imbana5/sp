    "explain": "<p>Convection is one way to transport energy/heat in a star by rising and falling of gas elements. The main idea is hot gas from deeper part of a star will have less density and move upward closer to the star's surface, transporting its energy/heat to the surrounding. After that, the gas cools, gets denser and sinks downward. The gas then acquires energy from around the center of the star and the process occurs again repetitively.</p><p>A little bit more detailed explanation is the following. When a blob of hot gas from a deeper part of the star is rising slightly upward, the gas will find itself in a new environment. In a star, it is expected that the further from the center, the lower the temperature and pressure there is. Since the gas blob is now in a lower pressure environment, it will expand and cool. If the temperature gradient is steep, i.e. the surrounding temperature drops more than the hot blob of gas, then the gas blob's density will be less dense than the surrounding, since the gas is still hotter than its environment. Therefore the gas blob will continue to rise. The process keeps going on until the gas transfers its energy to its environment and gets cooler, denser than its surrounding. In that case, the gas blob will then sink back downward. Taking energy again from hot environment near the center of the star.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer for the question is D.</p>"
