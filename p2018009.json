Choose the right statement(s) below that corresponds to the evolution of single stars.</p><ol><li>High-mass stars have short lives, becoming hot enough to make iron, and end in nova explosions.</li><li>Stars of higher mass have higher core temperature and more rapid fusion, making those stars more luminous.</li><li>Low-mass stars have long lives, becoming hot enough to fuse carbon nuclei, and end as white dwarfs.</li><li>Intermediate-mass stars can make elements heavier than carbon and end as white dwarfs.</li></ol>",
